<p>In the absence of anything else to put here for the moment, here are some notes on the <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdotting</a> of CougaarForge that took place Nov 05, 2003.
<p>At about 1:40 AM EST, a story about CougaarForge (submitted by the ever-eloquent Aaron Helsinger) was posted to the front page of Slashdot.  Below is a chart of the results - the hits for each hour from Nov 4 - Nov 6:

<p>Misc notes:
<ul>
<li>The previous day (Nov 4) was actually a fairly busy day, since some links to CougaarForge had been posted to various agent sites.  
<li>These hit counts don't includes hits on various subdomains within CougaarForge, since those go to separate log files.  So the totals are actually a bit higher than posted here.  These are pretty representative, though.
<li>The dip at around 8:30 was when the Postgres database began running out of connections.  I raised <code>max_connections</code>, <code>shared_buffers</code>, and <code>sort_mem</code>, restarted the database, and all was well.  Sigh.  Learn something new every day.
<li>Joe is going to provide the router traffic graphs for the day, too.
