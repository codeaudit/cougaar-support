So you've just started a new CougaarForge project!  Congratulations.  Now, here are some things you might want to do to get a handle on your project:

The web site for your project is at /var/www/gforge-3.0/[yourproject]/.  You can copy content into that directory from Linux using secure copy, like this:

[tom@cougaarforge support]$ scp index.html
tom@cougaarforge.cougaar.org:/var/www/gforge-3.0/support/
index.html           100%
|**********************************************************************|    25

[tom@cougaarforge support]$

From Windows, you can use secure copy if you download pscp from the Putty web
site -
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.  Use it like
this:

C:\>pscp test.html 
tom@cougaarforge.cougaar.org:/var/www/gforge-3.0/support/
tom@cougaarforge.cougaar.org's password:
test.html                 |         11 kB |  11.2 kB/s | 
ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%

C:\>

You've probably got some code you want to import into the CVS repository.
  You can do that using the CVS import command:

[tom@cougaarforge support]$ cvs import -m "initial import" support tom start
N support/test.txt

No conflicts created by this import

[tom@cougaarforge support]$ 

Or, if you already have a CVS repository in place, we can copy that into the
CougaarForge CVS tree so you can keep all your branches and history and such.
If you want to do that, please post a note to the Support project -
http://cougaarforge.cougaar.org/projects/support/.

To make sure you get notified when anything happens on your project, you can
  go to each of the "trackers" - i.e., the bug tracker, the feature request
tracker - and enable email notification.  To do that, go to your project page,
click on "Tracker" on the left side of the page, click on "Admin" at the top
of the page, click on "Bugs", click on "Update preferences", and put your
email address in the "Send email on new submission to address:" box.  Also,
you can check the box right below it that says "Send email on all changes".

You might also want to go to the discussion forums and click the "monitor"
button at the top of each forum.  That way you'll get an email if someone
posts to the forum.

Please post to the "Support" forum
- http://cougaarforge.cougaar.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=6 -  if you have a suggestion for improving this
document, thanks!
