#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Configuration file for ViewCVS
#
# Information on ViewCVS is located at the following web site:
#     http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# BASIC CONFIGURATION
#
# For correct operation, you will probably need to change the following
# configuration variables:
#
#    cvs_roots
#    default_root
#    rcs_path
#    mime_types_file
#
# It is usually desirable to change the following variables:
#
#    address
#    main_title
#    forbidden
#
#    use_enscript
#    use_cvsgraph
#
# For Python source colorization:
#
#    py2html_path
#
# If your icons are in a special location:
#
#    icons
#
# Also, review the .ezt templates in the templates/ directory to adjust them
# for your particular site.
#

#
# FORMAT INFORMATION
#
# This file is delineated by sections, specified in [brackets]. Within each
# section, are a number of configuration settings. These settings take the
# form of: name = value. Values may be continued on the following line by
# indenting the continued line.
#
# WARNING: indentation *always* means continuation. name=value lines should
#          always start in column zero.
#
# Comments should always start in column zero, and are identified with "#".
#
# Certain configuration settings may have multiple values. These should be
# separated by a comma. The settings where this is allowed are noted below.
#
# Any other setting that requires special syntax is noted at that setting.
# 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[general]

#
# This setting specifies each of the CVS roots on your system and assigns
# names to them. Each root should be given by a "name: path" value. Multiple
# roots should be separated by commas.

# This is a pathname to a MIME types file to help viewcvs to guess the
# correct MIME type on checkout.
#
# If you are having problems with the default guess on the MIME type, then
# uncomment this option and point it at a MIME type file.
#
# For example, you can use the mime.types from apache here:
#mime_types_file = /usr/local/apache/conf/mime.types

# This address is shown in the footer of the generated pages. 
# It must be replaced with the address of the local CVS maintainer.

#
# This should contain a list of modules in the repository that should not be
# displayed (by default or by explicit path specification).
#
# This configuration can be a simple list of modules, or it can get quite
# complex:
#
#   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it
#      is NOT forbidden. Whenever this form is seen, then all modules will
#      be forbidden unless one of the "!" modules match.
#
#   *) Shell-style "glob" expressions may be used. "*" will match any
#      sequence of zero or more characters, "?" will match any single
#      character, "[seq]" will match any character in seq, and "[!seq]"
#      will match any character not in seq.
#
#   *) Tests are performed in sequence. The first match will terminate the
#      testing. This allows for more complex allow/deny patterns.
#
# Tests are case-sensitive.
#
forbidden =

# Some examples:
#
# Disallow "example" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example
#
# Disallow "example1" and "example2" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example1, example2
#
# Allow *only* "example1" and "example2":
#   forbidden = !example1, !example2
#
# Forbid modules starting with "x":
#   forbidden = x*
#
# Allow modules starting with "x" but no others:
#   forbidden = !x*
#
# Allow "xml", forbid other modules starting with "x", and allow the rest:
#   forbidden = !xml, x*, !*
#

#
# This option provides a mechanism for custom key/value pairs to be
# available to templates. These are stored in key/value files (KV files).
#
# Pathnames to the KV files are listed here, specified as absolute paths
# or relative to this configuration file. The kV files follow the same
# format as this configuration file. It may have multiple, user-defined
# sections, and user-defined options in those sections. These are all
# placed into a structure available to the templates as:
#
#    kv.SECTION.OPTION
#
# Note that an option name can be dotted. For example:
#
#    [my_images]
#    logos.small = /images/small-logo.png
#    logos.big = /images/big-logo.png
#
# Templates can use these with a directive like: [kv.my_images.logos.small]
#
# Note that sections across multiple files will be merged. If two files
# have a [my_images] section, then the options will be merged together.
# If two files have the same option name in a section, then one will
# overwrite the other (it is unspecified regarding which "wins").
#
# To further categorize the KV files, and how the values are provided to
# the templates, a KV file name may be annotated with an additional level
# of dotted naming. For example:
#
#    kv_files = [asf]kv/images.conf
#
# Assuming the same section as above, the template would refer to an image
# using [kv.asf.my_images.logos.small]
#
# Lastly, it is possible to use %lang% in the filenames to specify a
# substitution of the selected language-tag.
#
kv_files =

# example:
# kv_files = kv/file1.conf, kv/file2.conf, [i18n]kv/%lang%_data.conf
#

#
# The languages available to ViewCVS. There are several i18n mechanisms
# available:
#
#   1) using key/value extension system and reading KV files based on
#      the selected language
#   2) GNU gettext to substitute text in the templates
#   3) using different templates, based on the selected language
#
# ### NOTE: at the moment, the GNU gettext style is not implemented
#
# This option is a comma-separated list of language-tag values. The first
# language-tag listed is the default language, and will be used if an
# Accept-Language header is not present in the request, or none of the
# user's requested languages are available. If there are ties on the
# selection of a language, then the first to appear in the list is chosen.
#
languages = en-us

# other examples:
#
# languages = en-us, de
# languages = en-us, en-gb, de
# languages = de, fr, en-us
#

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[templates]

#
# The templates are specified relative to the configuration file. Absolute
# paths may be used, if you want to keep these elsewhere.
#
# If %lang% occurs in the pathname, then the selected language will be
# substituted.
#
# Note: the selected language is defined by the "languages" item in the
#       [general] section, and based on the request's Accept-Language
#       header.

# WARNING:
#
#   Enabling this option can consume HUGE amounts of server time. A

#   expression.
#
#
# SECURITY WARNING:  Denial Of Service
#
#   Since a user can enter the regular expression, it is possible for
#   them to enter an expression with many alternatives and a lot of
#   backtracking. Executing that search over thousands of lines over
#   dozens of files can easily tie up a server for a long period of
#   time.
#
# This option should only be used on sites with trusted users. It is
# highly inadvisable to use this on a public site.
